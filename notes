	- Individual philosophers structure

	- Main thread looping death check

	- Custom sleep function (looping usleep for 10ms)

	- Offsetting thread start on odd or even philos (avoiding akward forks dispotition)

	- Mutexes on variables :
		- Time check
		- Death
		- Forks
		- Timestamp print


Try to deduce if each philo will survive the next step then custom sleep
for the calculated time of death, lock display mutex and return
